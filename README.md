# sql-challenge

## Description
6 csv files were provided and a SQL table schema had to be created for each. I drew out an ERD to display the relationships between the tables, and created these schemas with the appropriate primary and foreign keys in the `table_schema_creation.sql` file. Various queries were then ran in the `queries.sql` file to answer questions about the company and its employees.

### Foreign Keys
I utilized the link below for help writing my reference statements for the foreign keys on each table. The foreign key and primary key concept is still a little tricky for me, so once I had the keys figured out I used trial and error to find the method of referencing the foreign key until I found that the foreign key (column_x) references table(column_y) method worked.

### Joining Tables
Just like with the foreign keys, I was having a hard time writing working join statements before this homework assignment. I used the link below to help write and structure correct join statements that I could also use on other queries to join three tables. I feel much more confident writing these statements after this homework.

### Frequency Count
I knew we had done a practice problem during class one day where we had to get a frequency count and display the results in descending order, but I could not remember how to do so. I used the Stack Overflow link below for help with the syntax of this kind of statement and modified it to fit my specific query.
